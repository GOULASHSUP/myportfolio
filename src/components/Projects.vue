                  At the end of the first semester, as a member of a four person team we worked for a client who organises an event in 2023 which focuses on bbq in Denmark. We had to do research first than design and coding, and at the end we had to create a report that included information about our design/coding choices plus the whole process of our work.                 </p>
              
                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  We used Visual Studio Code for coding and Adobe Xd for designing, and programs such as Github, OneDrive, Google Drive, Notion and Discord to work remotly, when we couldn't meet in person during the project. At the end of the project we getherd knowladge about design and coding, but we also learned how to work and communicate as a team.

                  When I was studying in Hungary in my high school, during the final year each member of the class had to complete a project, which lasted for a year. During these 365 days I worked with the topic: Street art. I collected information about how graffiti and other forms of street art effected the sociate.

                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  I talked with people, who are active part of this community or worked with organizations which create events for people who enjoy street art.
                  As a result of my one year project, I designed and painted my primary schools new logo on their entrance.                 </p>

              <p class="text-lightgray text-xl">With one of my classmates, we created a basic website for a fictional traveling agency.</p>
              <div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row pt-2 gap-4 lg:gap-6">
                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  Me and one of my best friends worked on a website design/layout where we tried to recreate a traveling agency's website. 
                  Our goal with this was to create a website from the ground to practice and use our skills that we were currently studying at our university. 
                  We started with the design.

                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  By useing Adobe Xd we created the layout and the prototype which had the basic functionalities as well. After this we work on the codeing.
                  This project was only a little experimental thing, where our target was to use the skills and the knowladge that we would like to implement in the future projects with real clients.

              <p class="text-lightgray text-xl">With some of my classmates during a few months we created an Adobe Xd prototype for a mobile remote job application.</p>

                  From the second half of my first semester our class had an ongoing project, where we had to create an Adobe Xd prototype for an app which was similar to LinkedIn, but it was specificly designed for students/people who would like to work abroad or remotely.The main focus during the project was on the research behind the application, so the members of the team and me created journey maps, personas and value maps. 
                </p>
              
                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  We used our own knowladge and templates to create the content behind this fictional mobile app. We also had to think and research about the colours and fonts that we wanted to use. 
                  After all the research we created an Adobe Xd prototype for the app.                </p>

                  As a one week project, with a small team we had to create a fictional event, which would take place in the city of Esbjerg in 2023. Our group came up with the idea of a beer festival, which would work together with local pubs and bars, where local residents and tourists from all around the world could try out the different hand crafted beers of Esbjerg.                 </p>
              
                <p class="text-darkgray lg:w-1/2">
                  We created a social media campaign and a plan for the next half year on SoMe site posts such as Facebook, Insagram and Tiktok. A short 1-3 minute video was also required, so we shooted a 45 second trailer video for the event, where we tell a little bit about the event it self and show videos and pictures of the city to get the peoples attention.
