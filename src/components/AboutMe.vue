            <p class="pb-5">My Name is Simon Jobbágy and I am coming from Hungary, where I lived for 19 years.</p>
            <p class="pb-5">I Studied in a Waldorf primary and high school where I learned about creativity and how I can create awesome stuff with my own imagination and hands. </p>
            <p class="pb-5">After my high school years I moved to Denmark where studied multimedia design. There I learned how to use programs such as Adobe Indesign, Illustrator and Photoshop to create my own material and pictures for projects that I am involved in. </p>
            <p class="pb-5">I also learned how to use Visual Studio Code, together with Vue to create websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. </p>
            <p class="pb-5">So I can create websites using these programs, and I can also create design for projects. 
If you are interested what I did before or in what kind of projects I worked previously, you can check the Projects menu point on this site.</p>
<p class="pb-5">I am a hard worker, who enjoys challenges and projects, where I can try out new techniques and gether knowladge.</p>
